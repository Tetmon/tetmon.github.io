      <h5>EdgeSet is now available in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</h5>
      <p>9 June 2022, Singapore – Deeptech startup <a href="https://www.tetmon.com">Tetmon</a> has just inked a regional expansion agreement with <a href="https://www.newgens.com.sg">NewGens</a>, strategic SWIFT partner for Southeast Asia, to make Tetmon’s flagship data integration product EdgeSet available in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>

      <p>Organisations inevitably collect data from multiple sources, leading to many disparate data sources that are difficult to manage. Despite advances in IT infrastructure, organisations are still not harnessing the true value of this data. This is because data is often not centralised; even with traditional or cloud data warehouse solutions, information remains largely disparate and siloed.</p>

      <p>EdgeSet represents a cost-effective way for anyone to scale up their data integration and analytics capabilities, in a secure and regulatory compliant manner, delivering a competitive edge that is a must-have in this challenging business environment.</p>

      <p>“Partnering with Tetmon, a Singapore-based start-up, in this region addresses real operational consolidation challenges across industries. Tetmon’s EdgeSet unique solution enables enterprises to join disparate cloud and on-premises databases to a single point of access in a no-code way, within minutes”, notes <b>Seah Sew Chye, director of NewGens</b>. </p>

      <p><b>Hu Yinghan, CEO of Tetmon</b>, said, “We value NewGens’ years of in-depth expertise in the regional banking space and respect their corporate culture of trust and competence. We are excited to partner with NewGens to jointly accelerate our go-to market efforts in Southeast Asia”.</p>

      <p>The extensive agreement, beyond regional sales expansion, also covers joint efforts for service implementation and developments to help various banks comply with regional banking regulations around compliance, including Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Technology Risk Management Guidelines.</p>
