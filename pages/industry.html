headline: Selected<br>in-house products & case&nbsp;studies
subhead: With our promise of early, rapid delivery, our past clients over-delivered on their internal project metrics and timelines.

sections:
  - headline: Our Domain Specialties
    subhead: Real Estate Investments
    icon: building
    content: We built a model that helped the client predict how long a property would stay on the market at a given price. This enabled the client to purge their portfolio and acquisition pipeline, avoiding multi-year holding periods. Aside from the model, we also improved on divergent and incomplete data sources.

  - headline: Data Lake and Analytics
    subhead: Insurance
    icon: shield
    content: After the client acquired a competitor with millions of patients, we connected the disparate data sources together, de-duplicated customer records, and built both simple dashboards and more complex statistical products. This enabled the client to profit from synergies beyond the price paid for the acquisition.

  - headline: Machine Vision
    subhead: Insurance
    icon: robot
    content: >
      The client wanted to automatically classify product images, but none of the commercially available machine vision models had been trained on the particular products sold.

      We built and integrated a custom machine vision algorithm, including the facilities for the staff to train examples in order to continuously improve the algorithm.

  - headline: Extending A Consumer Facing Product
    subhead: Financial Services
    icon: finance
    content: >
      The product was used daily by 4 million customers and new product features were several months behind schedule due to scaling up of clientâ€™s requests.

      We helped unblock the launch of the next product version, and implemented features such as natural language processing and analytics.
