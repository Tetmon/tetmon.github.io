The industry has long known the problems of centralizing data via ETL (Extract Transform Load):<ul><li><div><strong>ETL destroys data lineage</strong>: transforms happen before loads, discarding the original data. Transformed and aggregated data is difficult to understand and trust since it cannot be traced back to the source.</div></li><li><div><strong>ETL introduces lag</strong>: analysis and reports are based on data that is up to 24 hours stale.  And as data and reports grow, that often grows to 48 or 72 hours.</div></li><li><div><strong>ETL breaks easily</strong>: errors in the transforms or changes in the source data cascade through the process, at best resulting in missing data but more often leaving data in an inconsistent state and creating inaccurate reports.</div></li></ul><p>ELT (Extract Load Transform) has been proposed as a solution. And while an improvement, it still has problems. ELT can maintain data lineage, but it doesn’t solve reporting lag.</p><p>The newer alternative EtLT (Extract transform Load Transform) is a step backwards, sneaking untraceable transforms back into the pipeline and leading to questions about integrity of the data, all without solving reporting lag or fragility.</p><h2>The solution is distributed queries</h2><p>Fixing the problems with ETL requires a new approach. Distributed query engines are a new technology that don’t suffer any of the problems of ETL or E(t)LT (although they introduce some tradeoffs). EdgeSet integrates the Trino query engine, used by <a href="https://trino.io/users.html">some of the largest tech companies</a>.
