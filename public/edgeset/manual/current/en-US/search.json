    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the community of data-driven organizations.\nAs easy to use as a Data Science notebook. EdgeSet uses a simple and familiar notebook interface inspired by popular data science and analysis tools. Connecting to a data source is as simple as filling in the connection details. You can use the same SQL dialect to query any data source—even if the data source isn’t a SQL database.\nAs powerful as a Big Data cluster. EdgeSet can connect to any number of data sources and combine data from these sources in a single query. By pushing queries down to the sources, EdgeSet turns your scattered data sources into a distributed parallel data processing fabric."

The tradeoff is that load may increase on the data sources you add, so use read replicas when available (see Scaling)."

    "text": "13.1 Read replicas\nThe primary method of scaling EdgeSet for most data sources is through read replicas. Since EdgeSet offloads queries whenever possible to the data source, the performance of the EdgeSet-facing database will determine query performance.\nA simple architecture for high scalability and minimal disruption to other applications is to create a dedicated EdgeSet read replica for all data sources that support them."

    "text": "14.1 Column inference\nEach column of a tabular file can be of a certain type, such as integers or dates. EdgeSet will automatically infer the type of a column if all sampled cells in that column match a given type.

EdgeSet will use the first row as a header for the inferred schema because the raw schema will already have the same schema but without a header row."

    "text": "Does EdgeSet support window functions?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes EdgeSet support CTEs?\n\nYes.\n\nHow does EdgeSet handle tables with different collations?\n\nEdgeSet does not support setting or using collation(s). All string comparison and sorting is done by comparing unicode code points literally. For case-insensitive comparison, you can use LOWER(), UPPER(), or case-insensitive regular expressions. Note that these functions don’t support languages that have ambiguous case conversion (i.e. where one lowercase character could be represented various uppercase versions), but that should only be an issue if dealing with Eastern European languages."
