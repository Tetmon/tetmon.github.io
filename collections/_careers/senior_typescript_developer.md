**Senior Typescript Developer**

We have some Typescript work right now which we donâ€™t have bandwidth to execute. Experience is important as the work usually involves grokking either a new codebase or a new field quickly and in depth. 

Some clients prefer talking to you in person, we can be there for you if you are remote, but it would be easier to be onsite.

Due to the COVID situation restricting entry to work pass holders, and because you will need to spend time on client sites within Singapore, we can only interview Singapore citizen and Permanent Residents.
