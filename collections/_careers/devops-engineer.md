You will be responsible for:

Designing secure systems that can scale.
Testing and documenting what you build so that itâ€™s repeatable.
Extending and maintaining our internal infrastructure.
We do not currently provide on-call service to any clients, as they are large enough to have their own technical staff on call.

Recent projects:

Built a serverless CI/CD system using GitHub Actions + AWS CodeBuild for dozens of repositories.
Crawled and archived a representative sample of the hosts present in the .com zone file.
Created a certificate-based VPN on AWS + Terraform with automated credential generation and revocation.
You should:

Be able to write concise, understandable code that does one thing well.
Understand TCP/IP, layer 7, and network security.
Have experience with large-scale systems (hundreds of servers, millions of users, or petabytes of data) or be willing to learn through continuous peer feedback.
Technologies we use internally:

Our own infrastructure is small compared to our clients, but we take it just as seriously.

NixOS
Haskell
TypeScript
Bash (with ShellCheck)
