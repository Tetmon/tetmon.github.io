- Haskell
- Servant
- SQL
- Presto, Hive
- Nix

We’re looking for someone to join our backend engineers in developing EdgeSet, our virtual data warehouse. We have developed with reproducible builds (Nix) and strong type systems from day 1.

**You will be responsible for:**

- Developing a backend application that manages multiple services, including Presto and Hive
- Developing a Servant API for the application
- Adding NixOS integration tests that run against VMs
- Contributing technical documentation (MediaWiki)

**You should be confident with:**

- Concurrent programming
- REST APIs
- Security
- Relational databases and the relational model

Remote is OK. However, you’ll need to work with our developers in Europe and Singapore, so Europe or Singapore timezone preferred. When applying, include example(s) of your work (such as a link to your GitHub account or email attachments).
