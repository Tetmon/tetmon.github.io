We’re looking for someone to lead frontend development for our single-page application. The application targets modern standards only: no need to bend over backwards for old browsers. We focus on a highly polished UI and seamless UX rather than a large number of features. There’s lots of room to work with the latest development tools and interface languages, including experimenting with new techniques.

You should be confident with:

- TypeScript: purely functional programming style, the type system (e.g. discriminating unions)
- CSS: flexbox, transitions, inline SVG

Remote is OK. However, you’ll need to work with our developers in Europe and Singapore, so Europe or Singapore timezone preferred. When applying, include example(s) of your work (such as a link to your profile, GitHub account, CodePen account, or email attachments).
